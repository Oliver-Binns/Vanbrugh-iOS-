What time is dinner in Vanbrugh Dining Hall?
5:30pm to 7:30pm
Is the food any good?
Well that will be for you to decide, but there is a lot of options. Usually three a day with a vegetarian option as well. The menu is on a two week rota so if you did it tactically you could have something different every day for 6 weeks!
Where is the nearest supermarket?
There is a NISA on campus on the way to the library from Vanbrugh which is good for every day essentials but is quite expensive. Aldi, the cheapest option, is about a 15min walk away from Vanbrugh, if you head toward biology and across into the fields. If you follow the path you will reach the army barracks, of which Aldi is the other side. Morrisons provides the best choice but is about a 25min walk away, or a 5min bus ride from the library stop.
