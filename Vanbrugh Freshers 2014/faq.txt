Who is going to look after me?
No-one is going to look after you per-say, University is a place where students learn independence. However we understand that coming to a new place with new people can be daunting. Your STYCs are second and third year contacts that will help guide you about during your first week, from showing you where Morrisons is, to walking you home from the club, to joining you and your new friends to a BBQ outside your block. There are also welfare teams and other support teams both student based and resident on campus.
What time is dinner in Vanbrugh Dining Hall?
5:30pm to 7:30pm
Is the food any good?
Well that will be for you to decide, but there is a lot of options. Usually three a day with a vegetarian option as well. The menu is on a two week rota so if you did it tactically you could have something different every day for 6 weeks!
Where is the nearest supermarket?
There is a NISA on campus on the way to the library from Vanbrugh which is good for every day essentials but is quite expensive. Aldi, the cheapest option, is about a 15min walk away from Vanbrugh, if you head toward biology and across into the fields. If you follow the path you will reach the army barracks, of which Aldi is the other side. Morrisons provides the best choice but is about a 25min walk away, or a 5min bus ride from the library stop.
What if I donâ€™t want to go on the club night during freshers week?
Every evening there is an alternative event, this can range from a chill out acoustic night in the warren to a Fifa tournament in the JCR. Most events will not clash entirely though if you planned to go to both.
